2022 Fall Data Science Capstone Project repository for Team Accenture 4


#### Project Objective 

Business investment is a major pillar of economic growth. New business investment decision is fraught with many risks and other factors. New investment depends on the factors pertinent to policies and regulations, technology, and risk factors ( policy risk, economic risk etc.). New investment decision also depends on the industry sector/vertical. In this capstone project we will focus on two major sectors: Manufacturing and service.

Two major industries covered in this capstone project:

1.	Manufacturing
2.	Service

A time series forecasting (univariate / multivariate) model can be built to find the manufacturing and service trend in a particular country.

Manufacturing and Service, individually depends on many socio-economic factors including risk factors.

A country wise comparative assessment can be done to assess the better investment destination for a sector (Manufacturing/Service) than the others.
